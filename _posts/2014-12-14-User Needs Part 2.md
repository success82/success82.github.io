## User Needs Part 2

I broke the users down into 3 different segments. 
-MBA/MA students
-People that use Design Thinking on their jobs
-Entrepreneurs

I asked them what they wanted in their product and they gave me various answers. So I wrote them on a board and circled the common themes. 

Based on this experience I will focus my map on these items:
-Portable
-Easy to understand
-Simple
-Clear

Thanks to all that helped with this.
