It is very important that the design thinking map is portable. It will be very important that the customer is able to use this map wherever they are.

Here is the process.

The map had to be big enough to allow groups to write, but also small enough to allow for easy carrying. I was able to do that. The mobile whiteboard is the size of a sheet of paper folded up.
