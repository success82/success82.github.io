## User Needs
When developing a Design Thinking Map, I would have to use the Design Thinking process to develop it. The first thing I needed to do was look at needs. 

Before starting the MBA/MA program, I would normally just use the "put myself in their shoes" method to develop a product. This would usually would not turn out well because I haven't taken the time to really empathize with the user. 

## Starting at Home
The first user I started with was myself. I did this for two reasons. The first reason is because ultimately I plan to use this product in my work and studies. The second reason I started with myself was to be able to identify major problems with the product early. I didn't want to talk to potential users without having went through the process myself.

## My needs
After going through various personal brainstorming sessions, I came up with two key functions that were important.

**Function 1:** Easy to use- It needed to be easy to find information and use that information.

**Function 2:** Detailed- I would like something that gives me many different options. I desire something like a toolbox, something that has tools that fit different situaions. 

This was a very good start! See you next blog post.
