The purpose of my prototyping project is to create a way to navigate the design thinking process. My goal is  to provide this tool to the Design Thinking Community.



##Why is a map needed to navigate the Design Thinking Process?
Since starting the Design MBA Program, a majority of our work has been group design thinking projects. There are so many tools and processes available, that we have a hard time choosing the optimal path. A map that could provide different paths through these processes would be helpful for my classmates and I.



##How we will develop this Map?
I have compiled different design thinking books and websites and l plan to pull the best tools and processes from these resources and put them on a map that can be used for my Design Thinking projects. 

Thank you for coming along with me on my journey.
