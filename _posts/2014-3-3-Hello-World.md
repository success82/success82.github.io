title: Navigating the Design Thinking World

The purpose of my prototyping project is to create a way to navigate the design thinking process. My goal is  to provide this tool to the Design Thinking Community.



##Why is a map needed to navigate the Design Thinking Process?
Since starting the Design MBA Program, a majority of our work has been group design thinking projects. There are so many tools and processes available, that we have a hard time choosing the optimal path. A map that could provide different paths through these processes would be helpful for my classmates and I.



##How we will develop this Map?
I have compiled different design thinking books and websites and l plan to pull the best tools and processes from these resources and put them on a map that can be used for Design thinking projects. I have not totally defined exactly how this map will look, but it must meet the following criteria:



-Be mobile


-Be easy to read



##Tool Development
I would like to have tools available for the users of this map. The first tool I decided to develop was a mobile whiteboard. This mobile whiteboard would be the same dimensions as a standard sheet of paper and be able to be folded out and mounted on the wall for mobile brainstorming. Here are some pictures of my process.
