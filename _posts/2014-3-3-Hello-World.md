title: Navigating the Design Thinking World

The purpose of my prototyping project is to create a way to navigate the design thinking process. My goal is to have to provide this tool to the Design chinking Community

##Why is a map needed to navigate the Design Thinking Process?
Since starting the Design MBA Program, we have been assigned to work on many group design thinking projects. There are so many tools and processes available that we always have a hard time choosing the optimal path. This would lead to the group members arguing and the loss of solution development time. 

##How we will develop this Map?
I have compiled different design thinking books and websites. I will pull the best tools and processes from these websites and put them on a map that can be used for Design thinking projects. I have not totally defined exactly how this map will look, but it must meet the following criteria:

-Be able to be used mobile.
-Be easy to read

##Tool Development
I would like to have tools available for the users of this map. The first tool I decided to develop was a mobile whiteboard. This mobile whiteboard would be the same dimensions as a standard sheet of paper and be able to be folded out and mounted on the wall for mobile brainstorming. Here are some pictures of my process.
