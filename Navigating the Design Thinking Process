The purpose of my prototyping project is to create a way to navigate the design thinking process. My goal is to have to provide this tool to the Design Thinking community


##Why is a map needed to navigate the Design Thinking Process?
Since starting the Design MBA Program, we have been assigned to work on many group design thinking projects. There are so many tools and processes available that we always have a hard time choosing the optimal path. This would lead to the group members arguing and lost solution development time.
